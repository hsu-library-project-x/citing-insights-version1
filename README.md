# Citing Insights

A powerful web application designed to streamline assessment of students' information literacy and other skills. With Citing Insights, you can easily upload a student papers, the citations are detected and links to discovery tools make it easy to evaluate the sources. Discovery tools include Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar, and a Library's Alma Primo. Citing Insights is designed to automate using or editing AAC&U Information Literacy Value Rubrics, and other assessment rubrics, for assessing the student papers. You can also add annotation, and provide students feedback, or provide accrediting bodies with detailed assessment reports.
